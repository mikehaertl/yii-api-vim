*CCache*   >> |CApplicationComponent| >> |CComponent|
========

 CCache is the base class for cache classes with different cache storage
 implementation.

 A data item can be stored in cache by calling |CCache::set| and be retrieved
 back later by |CCache::get|. In both operations, a key identifying the data
 item is required. An expiration time and/or a dependency can also be
 specified when calling |CCache::set|. If the data item expires or the
 dependency changes, calling |CCache::get| will not return back the data item.

 Note, by definition, cache does not ensure the existence of a value even if
 it does not expire. Cache is not meant to be a persistent storage.

 CCache implements the interface |ICache| with the following methods:
   |CCache::get| : retrieve the value with a key (if any) from cache
   |CCache::set| : store the value with a key into cache
   |CCache::add| : store the value only if cache does not have this
   key
   |CCache::delete| : delete the value with the specified key from
   cache
   |CCache::flush| : delete all values from cacheChild classes must implement
 the following methods:
   |CCache::getValue|
   |CCache::setValue|
   |CCache::addValue|
   |CCache::deleteValue|
   |CCache::flushValues| (optional)
   serializeValue (optional)
   unserializeValue (optional)CCache also implements ArrayAccess so that it
 can be used like an array.


PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<behaviors>				*CCache::behaviors*
 See |CApplicationComponent::behaviors|

<hashKey>				*CCache::hashKey*
 (boolean) whether to md5-hash the cache key for normalization purposes.
 Defaults to true. Setting this property to false makes sure the cache key
 will not be tampered when calling the relevant methods |CCache::get|,
 |CCache::set|, |CCache::add| and |CCache::delete|. This is useful if a Yii
 application as well as an external application need to access the same cache
 pool (also see description of |CCache::keyPrefix| regarding this use case).
 However, without normalization you should make sure the affected cache
 backend does support the structure (charset, length, etc.) of all the
 provided cache keys, otherwise there might be unexpected behavior.

<isInitialized> 			*CCache::isInitialized*
 See |CApplicationComponent::isInitialized|

<keyPrefix>				*CCache::keyPrefix*
 (string) a string prefixed to every cache key so that it is unique. Defaults
 to null which means to use the |CApplication::getId|. If different
 applications need to access the same pool of cached data, the same prefix
 should be set for each of the applications explicitly.

<serializer>				*CCache::serializer*
 (array|boolean) the functions used to serialize and unserialize cached data.
 Defaults to null, meaning using the default PHP `serialize()` and
 `unserialize()` functions. If you want to use some more efficient serializer
 (e.g. 'igbinary'), you may configure this property with a two-element array.
 The first element specifies the serialization function, and the second the
 deserialization function. If this property is set false, data will be
 directly sent to and retrieved from the underlying cache component without
 any serialization or deserialization. You should not turn off serialization
 if you are using |CCacheDependency|, because it relies on data serialization.

    [expire] (integer) the number of seconds in which the cached value will

    [key] (string) the key identifying the value to be cached
    [value] (string) the value to be cached
    [expire] (integer) the number of seconds in which the cached value will

(boolean) if no error happens during deletion

 Deletes a value with the specified key from cache This method should be
 implemented by child classes to delete the data from actual cache storage.

*CCache::flush* 						 public
>
 flush()
<
(boolean) whether the flush operation was successful.

 Deletes all values from cache. Be careful of performing this operation if the
 cache is shared by multiple applications.


*CCache::flushValues*						 protected
>
 flushValues()
<
(boolean) whether the flush operation was successful.

 Deletes all values from cache. Child classes may implement this method to
 realize the flush operation.


*CCache::generateUniqueKey*					 protected
>
 generateUniqueKey($key)
<
(string) a key generated from the provided key which ensures the uniqueness
across applications

    [key] (string) a key identifying a value to be cached


*CCache::get*							 public
>
 get($id)
<
(mixed) the value stored in cache, false if the value is not in the cache,
expired or the dependency has changed.

 Retrieves a value from cache with a specified key.
    [id] (string) a key identifying the cached value

*CCache::getValue*						 protected
>
 getValue($key)
<
(string) the value stored in cache, false if the value is not in the cache or
expired.

 Retrieves a value from cache with a specified key. This method should be
 implemented by child classes to retrieve the data from specific cache
 storage. The uniqueness and dependency are handled in |CCache::get| already.
 So only the implementation of data retrieval is needed.
    [key] (string) a unique key identifying the cached value


*CCache::getValues*						 protected
>
 getValues($keys)
<
(array) a list of cached values indexed by the keys

 Retrieves multiple values from cache with the specified keys. The default
 implementation simply calls |CCache::getValue| multiple times to retrieve the
 cached values one by one. If the underlying cache storage supports multiget,
 this method should be overridden to exploit that feature.
    [keys] (array) a list of keys identifying the cached values

*CCache::init*							 public
>
 init()
<
(void)

 Initializes the application component. This method overrides the parent
 implementation by setting default cache key prefix.


*CCache::mget*							 public
>
 mget($ids)
<
(array) list of cached values corresponding to the specified keys. The array
is returned in terms of (key,value) pairs. If a value is not cached or
expired, the corresponding array value will be false.

 Retrieves multiple values from cache with the specified keys. Some caches
 (such as memcache, apc) allow retrieving multiple cached values at one time,
 which may improve the performance since it reduces the communication cost. In
 case a cache does not support this feature natively, it will be simulated by
 this method.
    [ids] (array) list of keys identifying the cached values


*CCache::offsetExists*						 public
>
 offsetExists($id)
<
(boolean) 

 Returns whether there is a cache entry with a specified key. This method is
 required by the interface ArrayAccess.
    [id] (string) a key identifying the cached value


*CCache::offsetGet*						 public
>
 offsetGet($id)
<
(mixed) the value stored in cache, false if the value is not in the cache or
expired.

 Retrieves the value from cache with a specified key. This method is required
 by the interface ArrayAccess.
    [id] (string) a key identifying the cached value


*CCache::offsetSet*						 public
>
 offsetSet($id, $value)
<
(void)

 Stores the value identified by a key into cache. If the cache already
 contains such a key, the existing value will be replaced with the new ones.
 To add expiration and dependencies, use the set() method. This method is
 required by the interface ArrayAccess.
    [id] (string) the key identifying the value to be cached
    [value] (mixed) the value to be cached


*CCache::offsetUnset*						 public
>
 offsetUnset($id)

 by the interface ArrayAccess.

 Stores a value identified by a key into cache. If the cache already contains
 such a key, the existing value and expiration time will be replaced with the
 new ones.
    [id] (string) the key identifying the value to be cached
    [value] (mixed) the value to be cached
    [expire] (integer) the number of seconds in which the cached value will
    expire. 0 means never expire.
    [dependency] (ICacheDependency) dependency of the cached item. If the
    dependency changes, the item is labeled invalid.


*CCache::setValue*						 protected
>
 setValue($key, $value, $expire)
<

 uniqueness and dependency are handled in |CCache::set| already. So only the
 implementation of data storage is needed.
    [key] (string) the key identifying the value to be cached
