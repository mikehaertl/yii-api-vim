*CAccessRule*   >> |CComponent|
=============

 CAccessRule represents an access rule that is managed by
 |CAccessControlFilter|.


PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<actions>				*CAccessRule::actions*
 (array) list of action IDs that this rule applies to. The comparison is
 case-insensitive. If no actions are specified, rule applies to all actions.

<allow> 				*CAccessRule::allow*
 (boolean) whether this is an 'allow' rule or 'deny' rule.

<controllers>				*CAccessRule::controllers*
 (array) list of controller IDs that this rule applies to. The comparison is
 case-insensitive.

<deniedCallback>			*CAccessRule::deniedCallback*
 (mixed) the denied method callback that will be called once the access is
 denied. It replaces the behavior that shows an error message. It can be a
 valid PHP callback including class method name (array(ClassName/Object,
 MethodName)), or anonymous function (PHP 5.3.0+). For more information, on
 different options, check

<expression>				*CAccessRule::expression*
 (string) a PHP expression whose value indicates whether this rule should be
 applied. In this expression, you can use '$user' which refers to
 'Yii::app()->user'. The expression can also be a valid PHP callback,
 including class method name (array(ClassName/Object, MethodName)), or
 anonymous function (PHP 5.3.0+). The function/method signature should be as
 follows:
>
 function foo($user, $rule) { ... }
<
 where $user is the current application user object and $rule is this access
 rule.

 The PHP expression will be evaluated using |CAccessRule::evaluateExpression|.

 A PHP expression can be any PHP code that has a value. To learn more about
 what an expression is, please refer to the 'php manual'.

<ips>					*CAccessRule::ips*
 (array) IP patterns.

<message>				*CAccessRule::message*
 (string) the error message to be displayed when authorization is denied by
 this rule. If not set, a default error message will be displayed.

<roles> 				*CAccessRule::roles*
 (array) list of roles this rule applies to. For each role, the current user's
 |CWebUser::checkAccess| method will be invoked. If one of the invocations
 returns true, the rule will be applied. Note, you should mainly use roles in
 an "allow" rule because by definition, a role represents a permission
 collection.

<users> 				*CAccessRule::users*
 (array) list of user names that this rule applies to. The comparison is
 case-insensitive. If no user names are specified, rule applies to all users.

<verbs> 				*CAccessRule::verbs*
 (array) list of request types (e.g. GET, POST) that this rule applies to.
